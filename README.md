. This research project aims to develop an emotion detection system designed for Roman Urdu text (tweets and comments), a variant of Urdu written in Roman script. The main objective is to create a benchmark dataset comprising of 10,000 Roman Urdu documents which was carefully annotated with emotion classifications, including Happy, Sad, Anger, Disgust, Surprise, Fear, and Neutral, with intensity classifications of high, medium, and low for each emotion. The dataset also considers negation within the context of the neutral emotion. Several baseline algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression, are employed to train and evaluate the emotion detection models. The experimental results highlight that Logistic Regression achieves the highest accuracy in emotion classification, while SVM demonstrates superior performance in intensity classification. This benchmark dataset and the corresponding results provide valuable resources for further advancements in emotion detection for Roman Urdu text.
